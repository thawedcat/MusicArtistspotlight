    <h2>And this is my favorite artists/musicians of all time.
    </h2>
    <p>I had a peculiar music taste like most of the people don't have because i like music that is weird and hard to understand or feel.You know in the song design, I like sounds that are very mechanic and robotic or more accurately metalic songs, I found these kinds of sound designs in electronic musics.So most of my favorite artists are electronic dance music producers. But there are also main stream artists that i also like. </p>
