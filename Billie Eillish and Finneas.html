        <p>Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell is an American singer and songwriter. She first gained public attention in 2015
        with her debut single "Ocean Eyes", which was subsequently released by Darkroom, an imprint of Interscope Records.
    These two are really talented brother and sister, finneas is a music producer who has been produced music for other artists including her sister of course.His song design is never restricted like this song has to be this instrument but rather he and billie inspire from any kind of sound or noices they encounter in their ordinary life and thats what i like about them so much. and the whole music structure of billie's songs has her personality like I do what I want I don't care , da!. </p>

    <div class="one"><h4 style="text-align: left;">I.Billie Eilish - bad guy.</h4>
        <p>Of course, this is on my fav list , the song is pretty poplular among pop culture of 20th century, the song design really looks like the one from plants and zombie.</p>

        <p>This song is introduced me by my girlfriend and the first time that i've listen to Billie and was my favorite song of Billie Eilish.Like I said , I love very weird song design so this horrorific song suites me perfectly.</p><video width="900px" height="1000px" poster="../pics/Billie-Eilish-2018-press-shot-web-optimised-1000.jpg" controls>

        <h4 style="text-align: left;">III.Finneas- What they'll say about us.</h4>
        <p>I should also cover finneas part right, this song is pretty unique. despite his songdesigns came out from billie, his own songs are very calmy and emotional.Like i almost makes you cry.</p>
